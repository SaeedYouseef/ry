    "about-text":"The 'Triangle of Life'  project began with the idea of human creation from soil, founded on a blend of hope, happiness, and health. Based on advanced scientific studies in mineral analysis using modern equipment like ICPMS-DCR, the project significantly reduced analysis time and costs.

Current research delves into the impact of minerals, herbs, and dietary supplements on human health.",
